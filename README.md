# Caesar Cipher (Python)

A Python console application that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The user chooses whether to encode or decode a message and provides a shift value to transform each letter in the alphabet. Non-alphabet characters are preserved, making the program more user-friendly.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditional logic, list indexing, and importing code from multiple files.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Make sure both files are in the same folder:

   caesar_cipher.py  
   art.py

4. Open a terminal (or your preferred Python IDE).
5. Navigate to the folder containing the files.
6. Run the script using:

   python caesar_cipher.py

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to encode or decode messages using different shift values.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Writing and calling functions with multiple parameters and arguments
- Looping through strings with `for`
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`)
- List indexing and subscripting
- Modulo operator (`%`) to wrap alphabet shifts
- Handling non-alphabet characters
- Importing code from another file
- Console-based user interaction
- Using ASCII art to enhance program output
